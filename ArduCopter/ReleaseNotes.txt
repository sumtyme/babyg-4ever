ArduCopter Release Notes:

------------------------------------------------------------------
ArduCopter 2.9-rc1 23-Dec-2012
Improvements over 2.8.1:
1) altitude hold improvements:
    a)inertial navigation for vertical axis [Randy/Jonathan/Leonard/Jason]
    b)accel based throttle controller [Leonard/Randy]
    c)accelerometer calibration routine updated to use gauss-newton method [Randy/Tridge/Rolfe Schmidt]
    d)parameters to control climb rate:
        AUTO_VELZ_MIN, AUTO_VELZ_MAX - allows you to control the maximum climb and descent rates of the autopilot (in cm/s)
        PILOT_VELZ_MAX - allows you to control the maximum climb/descent rate when in alt hold or loiter (in cm/s)
2) landing improvements [Leonard/Randy]
    LAND_SPEED - allows you to set the landing speed in cm/s
3) camera related improvements:
    a) AP_Relay enabled for APM2 and integrated with AP_Camera [Sandro Benigno]
    b) camera trigger with channel 7 switch or DO_DIGICAM_CONTROL mission command [Randy]
    c) allow yaw override by pilot or with CONDITIONAL_YAW command during missions [Randy]
        YAW_OVR_BEHAVE - Controls when autopilot takes back normal control of yaw after pilot overrides (0=after next wp, 1=never)
4) trad heli improvements [Rob]
    a) code tested and brought back into the fold (2.8.1 was never released for trad helis)
    b) enabled rate controller (previously only used angle controllers)
    c) fix to rotor speed controllers - now operates by switching off channel 8
    d) allow wider collective pitch range in acro and alt hold modes vs stabilize mode
    e) removed angle boost function because it created more problems than it solved
    f) bug fix to allow collective pitch to use the entire range of servos
5) mediatek gps driver improvements [Craig]
    a) added support for 1.9 firmware
    b) bug fix to start-up routine so sbas can be enabled
6) failsafe improvements (both throttle and battery) [Randy/Craig/John Arne Birkeland]
    a) RTL will not trigger if your throttle is zero - reduces risk of accidentally invoking RTL if you switch off your receiver before disarming
    b) failsafe triggered in unlikely case of a PPM encoder failure
    c) bug fix to resolve motors momentarily reducing to zero after failsafe is triggered
7) mpu6k filtering made configurable and default changed to 42hz for copters [Leonard/Tridge]
8) support ppm sum for transmitters with as few as 5 channels [Randy/John Arne Birkeland]
9) acro trainer - copter will return to be generally upright if you release the sticks in acro mode [Leonard]
    ACRO_BAL_ROLL, ACRO_BAL_PITCH - controls rate at which roll returns to level
    ACRO_TRAINER - 1 to enable the auto-bring-upright feature
10) other changes and bug fixes:
    a) allow >45 degrees when in stabilize mode by adding lines like below to APM_Config (compile time option only) [Jason]
        #define MAX_INPUT_ROLL_ANGLE 6000     // 60 degrees
        #define MAX_INPUT_PITCH_ANGLE 6000    // 60 degrees
    b) bug fix to stop RTL from ever climbing to an unreasonable height (i.e. >80m) [Jason]
    c) event and state logging [Jason]
    d) allow cli to be used over telemetry link [Tridge]
    e) bug fix to allow compass accumulate to run when we have spare cpu cycles [Randy]
    f) bug fix so do_set_servo command works [Randy]
    g) bug fix to PID controller's so they don't calculate crazy D term on the first call [Tridge]
    h) bug fix to initialise navigation parameter to resolve twitch when entering some navigation modes [Jason]
    i) performance improvement to copter leds - use DigitalFastWrite and DigitalFastRead instead of native arduino functions  [Randy]
    j) removed unused stab_d from roll and pitch controller [Jason]
    k) bug fix for guided mode not reaching target altitude if it reaches horizontal target first [Randy]
    l) code clean-up, parameter documentation improvements [Randy/Jason/Rob/others]

------------------------------------------------------------------
ArduCopter 2.8.1 22-Oct-2012
Improvements over 2.8:
- 430 bytes of RAM freed up to resolve APM1 level issue and reduce chance of memory corruption on both APM1 and APM2

Improvements over 2.7.3:
- Improved ACRO mode (Leonard Hall)
- Improved stability patch to reduce "climb-on-yaw" problem (Leonard, Rob Lefebvre, Randy)
- Rate controller targets moved to body frames (yaw control now works properly when copter is inverted) (Leonard/Randy)
- Less bouncy Stabilize yaw control (Leonard)
- OpticalFlow sensor support for APM2.5 (Randy)
- DMP works again by adding "#define DMP_ENABLED ENABLED" to APM_Config.h You can also log DMP vs DCM to the dataflash by adding "#define SECONDARY_DMP_ENABLED ENABLED" (Randy)
- Watch dog added to shutdown motors if main loop feezes for 2 seconds (Randy)
- Thrust curve added to linearize pwm->thrust. Removes deadzone found above 90% throttle in most ESC/motors (Randy)
- More timing improvements (main loop is now tied to MPU6000s interrupt) (Randy)
- GPS NMEA bug fix (Alexey Kozin)
- Logging improvements (log I terms, dump all settings at head of dataflash log) (Jason)

Bug Fixes / Parameter changes:
- fixed skipping of last waypoint (Jason)
- resolved twitching when no GPS attached (Tridge)
- fixed loss of altitude if alt hold is engaged before first GPS lock (Randy/Jason)
- moved Roll-Pitch I terms from Stabilize controllers to Rate controllers
- TILT_COMPENSATION param tuned for TradHeli (Rob)

Code Cleanup:
- HAL changes for platform portability (Pat Hickey)
- Removed INSTANT_PWM (Randy)
